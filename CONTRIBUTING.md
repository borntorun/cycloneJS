Thanks so much for taking the time to contribute!

Issues and Pull Requests are widely encouraged, whether it's a feature
request, bugfix, etc.

## To Contribute
First install the module
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/traviskaufman/cycloneJS.git
$ cd /path/to/cycloneJS
$ npm install .
```
Then just run `npm test` within the module's directory whenever you want to test. This will run jshint on all javascript
files as well as run tests against cyclone.

<strong>Pull requests that make `npm test` fail will *not* be
considered</strong>
